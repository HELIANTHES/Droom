# Factory Memory: Client Feedback

<client_feedback>
<!-- What clients have said about the systems we built — both praise and complaints. -->
<!-- These inform how agents should approach future builds. -->
<!-- Format: {date} [{client}] [{component}] Feedback summary. Implication for future builds. -->

<!-- This file is empty until the first client build. Record client reactions, feature requests, -->
<!-- complaints, and praise here so the factory learns what clients actually value. -->

<!-- Example entries (to be replaced with real feedback): -->
<!-- 2026-03-20 [zen-med-clinic] [dashboard] "The weekly report is too long, I just want to know what's working." → Client Translator prompt should aim for 3-5 key points, not comprehensive analysis. -->
<!-- 2026-04-10 [zen-med-clinic] [content-requests] "The shot lists were incredibly helpful, my intern could follow them exactly." → Publicist agent's detailed shot list approach is validated, maintain this level of specificity. -->
</client_feedback>
