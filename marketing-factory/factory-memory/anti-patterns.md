# Factory Memory: Anti-Patterns (What to Avoid)

<patterns_to_avoid>
<!-- Approaches that looked good in theory but failed in practice. -->
<!-- Format: [{business-type}] [{domain}] What was tried. Why it failed. What to do instead. -->

<!-- This file is empty until the first client build. Agents should consult this file during builds -->
<!-- to avoid repeating mistakes, and write to it when they discover approaches that don't work. -->

<!-- Example entries (to be replaced with real learnings): -->
<!-- [ecommerce] [n8n] Separate lead-scoring workflow adds complexity without value when Shopify already provides customer data. Integrate scoring into form-ingestion workflow instead. -->
<!-- [all] [dashboard] Dense Level 1 dashboards overwhelm non-technical clients. Keep executive view to 4 KPI cards + 1 AI narrative + 3 insights maximum. -->
