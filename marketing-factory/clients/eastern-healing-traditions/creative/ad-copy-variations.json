It is what happened for Patricia, who came in with sciatica so severe she could barely walk.

Twenty years of pain, resolved.\n\nDr. Vel Natarajan holds a DACM — the highest credential in Traditional Chinese Medicine. He does not guess. He conducts a thorough evaluation, explains exactly what is happening in your body, and builds a treatment plan specific to your condition, your history, and your life.\n\nThis is not about replacing your doctor. It is about exploring what becomes possible when you add 3,000 years of proven medicine to your care.\n\nIf you are living with chronic pain and nothing has worked well enough, a conversation costs you nothing but a phone call.",
