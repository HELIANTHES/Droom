# Brief 01: Surgery Cancellation Testimonial

## Content Theme & Audience
**Theme:** Patient transformation — Patricia J. canceled shoulder surgery after 3 acupuncture sessions, achieved 95% sciatica relief in 5.
**Target:** Pain Relief Seekers (40-65)
**Funnel Stage:** Consideration / Conversion

## Platform & Format
- **Primary:** YouTube + Facebook — video, 2:00-3:00
- **Secondary:** Instagram Reel — 30s cut highlighting the surgery cancellation moment
- **Orientation:** 16:9 (YouTube/Facebook), 9:16 (Reel)

## Campaign Objective
Drive consultation bookings from people considering surgery or managing chronic pain by showing a real patient outcome.

## Visual Direction
- **Setting:** Clinic treatment room (clean, warm). B-roll of Patricia in everyday life — gardening, carrying groceries, moving freely.
- **Subjects:** Patricia J. speaking directly to camera; Dr. Vel shown briefly during treatment context shots.
- **Composition:** Medium close-up for Patricia's testimony. Shallow depth of field to soften clinical background.
- **Lighting:** Soft natural window light supplemented with a warm LED panel. Avoid harsh overhead fluorescents.
- **Color Palette:** Ground in deep teal (#1a6b5a) and warm gold (#c9a96e) through set dressing — a throw pillow, wall art, branded elements in frame.
- **Camera Movement:** Slow push-in during the pivotal "I canceled my surgery" moment. Locked tripod otherwise.

## Tone & Mood
Professional-warm. Emotionally genuine, not melodramatic. Pacing starts with the weight of the problem, then opens up with relief and gratitude. Background music: solo acoustic guitar, understated, fading under dialogue.

## Messaging

### Hook (first 3 seconds / thumbnail text)
"I was scheduled for shoulder surgery. Then I tried acupuncture."

### Body
Patricia describes years of shoulder pain, the surgical recommendation, skepticism about acupuncture, and what happened after 3 sessions. Brief mention of sciatica relief in 5 sessions reinforces pattern. Dr. Vel provides one educational line about how acupuncture addresses inflammation and nerve signaling.

## Text Overlays
- 0:00 — "She was scheduled for surgery."

## What to Avoid
- Before/after claims that sound like guarantees ("acupuncture cures...")
- Stock footage of needles in extreme close-up — triggers needle anxiety
- Overly produced feel; this should feel like a real person telling her story, not an infomercial
- Sad piano music or any "miracle cure" framing
- Disparaging Western medicine — position as complementary, not adversarial
