# Brief 06: Autoimmune — Hashimoto's Story

## Content Theme & Audience
**Theme:** Condition education + patient narrative — how TCM approaches Hashimoto's thyroiditis as a whole-system condition, not just a thyroid problem. Draws on the pattern of patients like Jenna B. (hormonal balance and digestive issues resolved in 2 months).
**Target:** Autoimmune Warriors (30-55)
**Funnel Stage:** Awareness / Consideration

## Platform & Format
- **Primary:** YouTube + Facebook — video, 2:00-3:00
- **Secondary:** Instagram carousel adaptation (8-10 slides, 1080x1080)
- **Orientation:** 16:9 (YouTube/Facebook video), 1:1 (Instagram carousel)

## Campaign Objective
Reach women with Hashimoto's who are managed on levothyroxine but still experiencing fatigue, weight gain, brain fog, and digestive issues. Show that TCM addresses the autoimmune root, not just the thyroid number.

## Visual Direction

### Video
- **Setting:** Split between clinic (treatment/consultation scenes) and lifestyle footage of a woman in her 30s-40s going about daily life with energy — cooking, working, exercising.
- **Subjects:** Dr. Vel explaining the TCM perspective on autoimmune thyroid conditions. Patient stand-in or anonymized narrative voice representing the composite patient story.
- **Composition:** Talking-head segments with Dr. Vel framed in medium close-up. B-roll intercut with lifestyle and clinic footage. Text callouts for key statistics or TCM concepts.
- **Lighting:** Warm, natural. Clinic scenes lit to feel inviting. Lifestyle scenes use golden-hour or soft indoor light.
- **Camera Movement:** Minimal during Dr. Vel's segments (locked tripod). Gentle handheld for lifestyle b-roll to feel organic.
- **Color Palette:** Teal (#1a6b5a) in lower thirds and graphics. Gold (#c9a96e) for emphasis text. Warm color grading overall.

### Carousel
- Clean, text-forward slides following the video's narrative arc. One key insight per slide. Teal and off-white backgrounds, gold accent for statistics and CTAs.

## Tone & Mood
Empathetic and validating. Many Hashimoto's patients feel dismissed ("your levels are normal, you're fine"). This content says: "We hear you, and there's more to the picture." Pacing is measured — not urgent, not sleepy. Music: warm acoustic, female vocalist humming or light instrumental, low in mix.

## Messaging

### Hook (first 3 seconds / Slide 1)
"Your thyroid levels are 'normal' — but you still feel exhausted. Here's why."

### Body

**Video Script / Carousel Flow:**
1. The Hashimoto's gap: medication manages TSH, but many patients still experience fatigue, weight gain, brain fog, hair loss, digestive issues, and anxiety.
2. Why: Hashimoto's is an autoimmune condition — the immune system is attacking the thyroid. Levothyroxine replaces the hormone but doesn't address the immune dysregulation.
3. TCM perspective: In Chinese medicine, Hashimoto's patterns often involve spleen qi deficiency, kidney yang deficiency, and liver qi stagnation — all of which map to the exact symptoms patients report.
4. Treatment approach at Eastern Healing Traditions: Acupuncture to regulate the immune and endocrine response. Chinese herbal formulas tailored to the individual's pattern. Eastern nutrition protocols to reduce inflammatory triggers.
5. Real outcomes: Reference Jenna B.'s experience — hormonal balance and digestive issues resolved in 2 months of treatment.

### Close / CTA
Dr. Vel: "If your labs say you're fine but your body says otherwise, there's more we can do." Text overlay: "Book your consultation — EasternHealingTraditions.com" + phone number.

## Voiceover Script (Dr. Vel — key segment, ~45 seconds)
"Hashimoto's is not just a thyroid problem. It's an immune system problem. When I see a patient with Hashimoto's, I'm looking at the whole picture — digestion, energy, stress response, sleep. We use acupuncture to calm the immune response, herbal medicine to support the organs that are under strain, and nutrition to remove the triggers that keep the cycle going. The thyroid medication does its job. Our job is everything else."

## Key Elements Checklist
- [x] Condition education (Hashimoto's / autoimmune)
- [x] Patient narrative (Jenna B. referenced, composite story)
- [x] Dr. Vel on camera with educational content

## What to Avoid
- Suggesting patients stop taking levothyroxine or any prescribed medication
- Claiming to cure Hashimoto's or any autoimmune condition
- Using the word "holistic" (overused, codes as vague)
- Before/after weight loss imagery
- Making it exclusively about women — men get Hashimoto's too, though women are the primary audience
- Overly technical immunology language without plain-language pairing
