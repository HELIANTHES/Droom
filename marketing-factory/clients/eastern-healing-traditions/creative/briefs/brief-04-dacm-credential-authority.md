# Brief 04: DACM Credential Authority

## Content Theme & Audience
**Theme:** "Why Your Acupuncturist's Credentials Matter" — Establishing Dr. Vel's DACM as a differentiator in a market where credential levels vary widely.
**Target:** All audiences
**Funnel Stage:** Consideration

## Platform & Format
- **Primary:** Instagram carousel (6-8 slides, 1080x1080) + Facebook carousel
- **Secondary:** Facebook ad (single image with long-form caption)
- **Orientation:** 1:1 square

## Campaign Objective
Build trust and differentiate Dr. Vel from competitors with lower credentials. Educate the audience that not all acupuncturists have the same training level — and that the DACM is the highest degree in the field.

## Visual Direction
- **Setting:** Text-forward design. Professional headshot of Dr. Vel on slide 2 or 3 — shot in the clinic, wearing professional attire, warm expression.
- **Typography:** Bold, clean headlines. Credential hierarchy presented as a clear visual ladder or comparison chart.
- **Color Palette:** Deep teal (#1a6b5a) backgrounds for authority slides, off-white for explanation slides, gold (#c9a96e) to highlight "DACM" and key differentiators.
- **Imagery:** Dr. Vel's headshot, diploma/credential close-up if available, clean iconography for education levels. No stock photos.
- **Slide Layout:** High contrast, one concept per slide, generous white space.

## Tone & Mood
Confident and informative without arrogance. The goal is education, not ego — let the facts speak. The audience should leave thinking "I didn't realize there were different levels" and feeling reassured about choosing Dr. Vel.

## Messaging

## What to Avoid
- Directly naming or disparaging competitors with lower credentials
- Making it sound elitist — frame as "you deserve to know," not "others aren't good enough"
- Overloading slides with text; the hierarchy visual does the heavy lifting
- Using "doctor" without the qualifier "of Acupuncture and Chinese Medicine" — avoid implying MD
- Jargon-heavy explanations of the degree requirements
