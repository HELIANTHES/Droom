# Brief 03: First Appointment Walkthrough

## Content Theme & Audience
**Theme:** Treatment demystification — "What Your First Acupuncture Appointment Looks Like." Removes the unknown and reduces needle anxiety as a barrier to booking.
**Target:** All audiences — Pain Relief Seekers, Autoimmune Warriors, Wellness Optimizers
**Funnel Stage:** Consideration

## Platform & Format
- **Primary:** YouTube — video, 3:00-5:00
- **Secondary:** Instagram Reel — 60s condensed version
- **Orientation:** 16:9 (YouTube), 9:16 (Reel)

## Campaign Objective
Reduce the #1 barrier to booking (fear of the unknown / needle anxiety) by walking viewers through the full appointment experience at Eastern Healing Traditions.

## Visual Direction
- **Setting:** The actual clinic in Grayslake. Show the waiting area, consultation room, and treatment room. The space should feel clean, calm, and professional — not mystical.
- **Subjects:** Dr. Vel as host/guide. A willing patient or staff stand-in as the appointment subject.
- **Composition:** Follow-along documentary style. Over-the-shoulder shots during intake conversation. Wide establishing shots of each room. Close-ups of Dr. Vel's hands during needle placement (tasteful, not graphic — show from a distance that normalizes the scale of the needles).
- **Lighting:** Natural light where possible. Warm supplemental lighting. The clinic should feel inviting, not clinical.
- **Camera Movement:** Steady gimbal follow shots as Dr. Vel walks through the space. Locked tripod for the consultation and treatment segments.
- **Color Palette:** Let the clinic's natural environment carry the palette. Ensure any branded graphics (lower thirds, intro/outro) use teal (#1a6b5a) and gold (#c9a96e).

## Tone & Mood
Reassuring, conversational, lightly educational. Dr. Vel speaks directly to camera as if the viewer is the patient. Pacing is unhurried — the calm pace itself communicates safety. Background music: ambient pads, very low in the mix, nothing percussive.

## Messaging

### Hook (first 3 seconds)
"Nervous about your first acupuncture appointment? Let me show you exactly what happens."

### Body (structured walkthrough)
1. **Arrival** (0:15) — What to wear, what to bring, parking at the Grayslake location
2. **Intake** (0:45) — Dr. Vel explains the health history conversation, tongue/pulse diagnosis ("This is how I understand what's happening in your body")
3. **Treatment Plan** (1:30) — How Dr. Vel explains what he finds and which modalities he recommends
4. **Needle Placement** (2:15) — Show the actual needles (thin as a hair), demonstrate insertion on a willing subject. Emphasize: most patients feel nothing or a mild sensation.
5. **Rest Period** (3:00) — Patient rests 20-30 minutes. Show the calm environment.
6. **After** (3:30) — What to expect afterward: relaxation, possible mild soreness, hydration

### Close / CTA
Dr. Vel: "That's it. No mystery, no pain. If you've been curious, this is your sign." Text overlay: "Book your first visit — EasternHealingTraditions.com"

## Voiceover Script (Reel — 60s)
"Here's what actually happens at your first acupuncture appointment. First, we talk — I want to understand your full health picture. Then I check your pulse and tongue — it tells me more than you'd think. Next, the needles. They're thinner than a strand of hair. Most people don't feel them at all. You rest for about 20 minutes — most patients fall asleep. And that's it. No mystery. Book your first visit — link in bio."

## Key Elements Checklist
- [x] Clinic location featured prominently
- [x] Dr. Vel as on-camera host
- [x] Needle anxiety directly addressed
- [x] Educational (intake process, diagnosis methods)
- [x] Clear CTA with booking path
- [x] Modalities shown: Acupuncture (primary), pulse/tongue diagnosis

## What to Avoid
- Extreme close-ups of needle insertion — keep the perspective normalizing, not clinical
- Making it look painful or intense in any way
- New age music, incense, or anything that codes as "woo" — keep it professional
- Rushing the pacing; the calm tone is the message
- Showing the full face of any patient without explicit consent and release
