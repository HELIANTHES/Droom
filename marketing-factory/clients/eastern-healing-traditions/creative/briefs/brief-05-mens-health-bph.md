# Brief 05: Men's Health — BPH and Prostate Health

## Content Theme & Audience
**Theme:** "Natural Treatment Options for BPH and Prostate Health" — reaching men who are dealing with benign prostatic hyperplasia symptoms but may not be considering acupuncture or TCM as an option.
**Target:** Men 45-70
**Funnel Stage:** Awareness / Consideration

## Platform & Format
- **Primary:** Facebook ad — single image with long-form copy
- **Secondary:** Google Search ad copy (responsive search ad format)
- **Orientation:** 1200x628 (Facebook feed image), text-only (Google)

## Campaign Objective
Capture an underserved male audience that rarely encounters TCM marketing. Drive awareness that acupuncture and herbal medicine have clinical applications for BPH, and generate consultation bookings.

## Visual Direction
- **Setting:** Single image composition — a man in his 50s-60s, active and confident. Outdoors or in a casual lifestyle setting (workshop, hiking trail, golf course). Not in a clinical environment.
- **Composition:** Subject looking at or slightly past camera. Confident posture. The image should say "vitality" without being generic fitness stock photography.
- **Color Palette:** Warm, grounded tones. Dark teal (#1a6b5a) used in the text overlay bar or branded frame. Gold (#c9a96e) for the CTA button or headline accent. Avoid overly bright or "wellness-y" color grading.
- **Typography:** Bold, direct headline. No cursive, no soft fonts. This audience responds to straightforward communication.

## Tone & Mood
Direct, respectful, no-nonsense. Acknowledge the discomfort of the topic without dwelling on it. Speak to men the way they want to be spoken to about health — factually, with a clear path forward. No shame, no scare tactics.

**Hook (first line, before "See More"):**
"Getting up 3 times a night? There's a reason your urologist didn't mention this option."

**Body:**
"Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) affects over half of men by age 60. The symptoms — frequent urination, weak flow, nighttime trips to the bathroom — are more than inconvenient. They affect your sleep, your energy, and your quality of life.

Most men are offered medication (with side effects) or told to wait until surgery becomes necessary. But acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine have been treating prostate and urinary conditions for centuries — and modern research supports their effectiveness.

At Eastern Healing Traditions in Grayslake, Dr. Vel Natarajan (DACM) creates individualized treatment plans using acupuncture, targeted herbal formulas, and Eastern nutrition protocols to address BPH symptoms at the root.

No pharmaceuticals. No surgery. Real results."

- Overpromising: avoid "cure" or guaranteed outcomes
- Clinical imagery of prostate anatomy or urological equipment
- Generic "men's wellness" lifestyle shots (man meditating on a rock)
- Competing with pharmaceutical ads on their terms — lean into the natural, root-cause angle
- Any language that could be interpreted as diagnosing or replacing urological care
