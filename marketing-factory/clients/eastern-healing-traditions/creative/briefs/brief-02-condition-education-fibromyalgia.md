# Brief 02: Condition Education — Fibromyalgia

## Content Theme & Audience
**Theme:** "What Your Doctor Didn't Tell You About Fibromyalgia" — educating patients on how TCM views and treats fibromyalgia differently than conventional approaches.
**Target:** Pain Relief Seekers (40-65), Autoimmune Warriors (30-55)
**Funnel Stage:** Awareness / Consideration

## Platform & Format
- **Primary:** Instagram carousel (8-10 slides, 1080x1080) + Facebook carousel
- **Secondary:** Blog post adaptation (800-1000 words) for Google Search
- **Orientation:** 1:1 square (carousel), long-form text (blog)

## Campaign Objective
Position Dr. Vel as a knowledgeable authority on fibromyalgia treatment. Capture search traffic and social engagement from people frustrated with conventional management.

## Visual Direction
- **Setting:** Text-forward carousel design on teal (#1a6b5a) and off-white backgrounds. Accent gold (#c9a96e) for highlighting key statistics or pull quotes.
- **Typography:** Clean sans-serif headlines, serif body text for warmth. High contrast for readability.
- **Imagery:** Minimal — one lifestyle photo of a woman mid-40s looking relieved or calm (not in pain). Anatomical illustrations showing meridian points related to fibromyalgia patterns. No stock photos of people grimacing.
- **Slide Layout:** Each slide delivers one idea. White space is generous. No visual clutter.

## Tone & Mood
Educational and validating. The reader should feel seen ("your pain is real") and then informed ("here's what's actually happening"). Pacing builds from empathy to knowledge to invitation. No music (static format).

## Messaging

## Text Overlays (per slide)
Each slide is primarily text. Headlines in bold teal, supporting text in dark gray (#2d3436). Gold (#c9a96e) used for statistics, emphasis words, and the CTA button graphic.
