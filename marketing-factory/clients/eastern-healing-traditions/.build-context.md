<decisions>
[website-architect] Expanded from 6 to 28 pages with dynamic routes for services and conditions. Reasoning: original site had individual therapy pages and condition categories that drove SEO traffic. Competitive research identified condition-specific pages as the #1 SEO opportunity.
[website-architect] Used generateStaticParams for all dynamic routes (7 services, 6 conditions). Reasoning: SSG provides best performance and SEO for content that changes infrequently.
[website-architect] Added first-visit guide with 7-step walkthrough + FAQ. Reasoning: needle anxiety is a major conversion barrier; educating new patients reduces friction.
[website-architect] Cross-linked services ↔ conditions ↔ testimonials throughout the site. Reasoning: internal linking improves SEO and helps visitors discover relevant content.
[n8n-architect] Temporal orchestration: creative-rotation (1AM) → daily-performance (2AM) → budget-optimization (3:30AM) → learn-and-remember (4AM). Reasoning: each workflow depends on the previous — rotation must happen before performance analysis, budget adjusts after fresh metrics, and learning captures all decisions.
[n8n-architect] Form ingestion uses 3-tier lead scoring (hot/warm/cold) with Claude. Reasoning: TCM clinic has limited appointment slots, so prioritizing high-intent leads (specific conditions, urgency signals) for immediate follow-up maximizes conversion.
