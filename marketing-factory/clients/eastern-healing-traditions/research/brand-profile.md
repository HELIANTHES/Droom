**Industry:** Traditional Chinese Medicine / Holistic Healthcare / Alternative Medicine
**Founded By:** Dr. Vel Natarajan, DACM (Doctor of Acupuncture and Chinese Medicine)

The core promise is healing "without side effects."

## Services & Therapeutic Modalities

Eastern Healing Traditions offers seven primary therapies:

### Core Modalities
1. **Acupuncture** — The flagship service. Needle-based therapy that stimulates the body's natural healing response. Used across virtually all conditions the practice treats.
2. **Chinese Herbal Medicine** — Custom herbal formulations prescribed to address internal imbalances of Qi (vital energy). Complements acupuncture treatments.
3. **Eastern Nutrition / Food-Therapy** — Dietary guidance based on TCM principles. Food as medicine — tailored nutritional recommendations based on individual constitution and condition.

### Specialized Techniques
4. **Dry Needling** — Targeted musculoskeletal pain relief. Positioned as a technique to "reduce pain and restore function."
5. **Moxibustion** — Heat-based therapy using burning mugwort on specific body points. Increases blood circulation and relieves pain.
6. **Microacupuncture 48 (MA48) / Electroacupuncture** — Advanced acupuncture technique combining traditional needle placement with electrical stimulation for enhanced therapeutic effect.

### Complementary Therapies
7. **Tui-na, Guasha, and Cupping** — Manual therapy techniques used alongside acupuncture. Guasha and cupping are frequently combined with acupuncture for complex cases (e.g., Patricia J.'s rotator cuff treatment).

### Treatment Philosophy
- Thorough initial consultation with comprehensive health history
- Hands-on evaluation before treatment begins
- Thorough, easy-to-understand explanations at each step
- Individualized treatment plans based on condition acuity, patient age, and lifestyle factors
- Education-forward: patients understand WHY each treatment is recommended
- Treatment timelines are set realistically — acute conditions resolve faster, chronic conditions require patience

## Conditions Treated (Specialization Areas)

The practice organizes its expertise into six condition categories:

1. **Chronic Pain Relief** — Fibromyalgia, migraines, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, spinal stenosis, complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), myofascial pain syndrome
2. **Autoimmune Disorders** — Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, IBS, lupus (SLE), Hashimoto's thyroiditis, hyperthyroidism, psoriatic arthritis, chronic fatigue syndrome, Raynaud's syndrome
3. **Neuropathy** — Peripheral nerve dysfunction causing numbness, tingling, weakness
4. **Women's Health** — PMS, menstrual irregularities, PCOS, endometriosis, uterine fibroids, interstitial cystitis, low libido
5. **Men's Health** — BPH, elevated PSA/PHI, erectile dysfunction, low libido, urinary symptoms
6. **General Wellness** — Preventative health, digestive issues, fatigue, anxiety, sleep disorders, respiratory issues

This breadth is significant — the practice treats far more than the typical "back pain acupuncture" clinic, positioning Dr. Natarajan as a comprehensive TCM physician rather than a pain specialist alone.

## Brand Voice & Messaging

### Tone
- **Professional yet warm** — Medical credibility without clinical coldness
- **Educational** — Explanations are woven into every touchpoint. The brand doesn't just sell treatment; it teaches patients about their bodies and the medicine
- **Empathetic** — Language acknowledges patient suffering and frustration with conventional treatments
- **Confident without being aggressive** — Claims are backed by patient outcomes, not hype

### Key Messages
- **Primary tagline:** "Relieve your pain, return you to health, & maintain your lasting wellness without side effects"

- **Trust signal:** Dr. Natarajan holds a DACM (Doctorate of Acupuncture and Chinese Medicine) — highest TCM credential
- **Differentiation:** Thorough consultation process, patient education, individualized plans — not cookie-cutter treatments

### Language Patterns

- Acknowledges treatment timelines honestly rather than promising instant cures

## Visual Brand

### Color Palette
- **Primary:** Deep teal/green — calming, natural, associated with healing
- **Secondary:** Warm earth tones — grounding, organic
- **Accent:** Clean white backgrounds with professional healthcare aesthetic

### Typography
- Elegant, minimalist logotype in dark tones
- Clean, modern serif or sans-serif fonts — professional healthcare feel
- Not overtly "Eastern" in visual design — avoids bamboo/dragon clichés

### Imagery
- Active lifestyle photography (people in motion, wellness activities)
- Clean, professional clinical imagery
- Nature-inspired elements without being excessively spiritual
- Focus on outcomes: healthy, active people rather than treatment process photos

### Overall Aesthetic
Modern wellness clinic meets ancient wisdom. The visual brand bridges Eastern and Western sensibilities — it looks like a contemporary healthcare practice, not a stereotypical TCM clinic. This is strategic: it makes the practice approachable for patients who might be skeptical of "alternative" medicine.
