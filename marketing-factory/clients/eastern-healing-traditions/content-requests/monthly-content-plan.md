|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Patricia J. testimonial — full video (2:00-3:00) | Video | YouTube, Facebook | Brief 01 | |

**Production Deadline:** All raw footage and images due by Day 3. Graphics designed by Day 5. Published by Day 7.

**Filming Efficiency Notes:**
- Film Patricia's testimonial first while she is fresh and comfortable.
- After Patricia wraps, keep the camera setup and film Dr. Vel's headshot and consultation shots in the same treatment room.
- Capture Patricia's lifestyle b-roll at her home or outdoors on the same day or a separate quick visit.

**Filming Efficiency Notes:**
- Brief 02 and Brief 05 are primarily graphic/image-based. Minimal filming required.
- The BPH lifestyle image of an active man can be captured outdoors in a single quick session. A patient volunteer, friend, or Dr. Vel himself could serve as the subject.
- The fibromyalgia lifestyle image can be captured during the same session if subjects are available.

**Filming Efficiency Notes:**
- This is the heaviest filming day of the month. Block 3-4 hours.
- Walk through the clinic in order: waiting area, consultation room, treatment room. Film establishing shots of each space first, then film Dr. Vel's walkthrough in sequence.
- Capture all still images during the video filming session — pause between video takes to shoot stills.
- The needle size-comparison photo (needle next to a penny or hair) is a separate quick setup.

**Filming Efficiency Notes:**
- Film Dr. Vel's talking-head educational segments at the clinic first. Same setup as Week 1 — if using the same camera position, this goes fast.
- Lifestyle b-roll of a woman (patient volunteer or model stand-in) can be filmed the same afternoon at a separate location — kitchen, park, walking trail.
- Capture the treatment room image during the same session if a willing subject is available.

## Filming Efficiency Tips

1. **Batch similar setups.** All talking-head segments (Dr. Vel at the clinic) can be filmed back-to-back across briefs. If you film Week 1 and Week 4 talking heads on the same day, you save an entire setup.
2. **Capture stills during video shoots.** Pause between video takes to snap photos. This avoids scheduling separate photo sessions.
3. **Wardrobe consistency.** Dr. Vel should wear the same professional attire for all clinic footage within a given month so content looks cohesive when published across weeks.
4. **Lifestyle b-roll bank.** When you film lifestyle footage (patients gardening, cooking, walking), capture extra clips and stills. Store them for use in future months.
5. **Golden hour scheduling.** For outdoor lifestyle footage, schedule filming 1-2 hours before sunset for warm, flattering light that matches the brand aesthetic.
