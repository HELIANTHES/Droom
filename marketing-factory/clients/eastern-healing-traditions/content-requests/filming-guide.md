# Filming Guide: Eastern Healing Traditions

**Client:** Dr. Vel Natarajan, DACM — Eastern Healing Traditions
**Purpose:** Practical reference for capturing video and photo content at or near the clinic
**Date:** February 2026

This guide is written for someone who may not have video production experience. Everything here can be done with an iPhone and minimal equipment. Read it once before your first filming session, then use it as a checklist each time you shoot.

---

## Part 1: Equipment

### What You Need (Budget Setup — iPhone)

You do not need professional cameras. A recent iPhone (iPhone 12 or newer) captures video and photos that are more than good enough for social media and YouTube.

**Essential (under $100 total):**

| Item | Why You Need It | Approximate Cost |
|---|---|---|
| iPhone (12 or newer) | Your camera. Shoot in 4K if your phone supports it. | Already owned |
| Phone tripod with adjustable legs | Keeps the camera steady. Shaky footage looks unprofessional. | $15-30 |
| Phone mount/clip for tripod | Attaches your phone securely to the tripod. | Often included with tripod |
| Lavalier (clip-on) microphone | Plugs into your phone for clear voice audio. Built-in phone mics pick up too much room echo. | $15-25 |
| Ring light or small LED panel | Adds soft, even light to your face. Eliminates harsh shadows. | $20-40 |

**Helpful but Optional (under $200 more):**

| Item | Why You Need It | Approximate Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Second LED light panel | Fills in shadows from the other side. Two lights look much better than one. | $20-40 |
| Wireless lavalier microphone set | No cord between the speaker and the phone. Easier for walkthrough videos. | $40-80 |
| Phone gimbal (stabilizer) | Keeps the phone perfectly smooth when you walk with it. Great for the clinic walkthrough video. | $80-120 |
| Portable backdrop or room divider | Hides clutter behind the speaker if the treatment room background is busy. | $30-50 |

### iPhone Camera Settings

Before you start filming, check these settings:

1. **Open Settings > Camera > Record Video.** Select **4K at 30fps.** This gives you the highest quality at a natural-looking frame rate.
2. **Turn off HDR Video** (Settings > Camera > toggle off HDR Video). HDR can cause color problems when editing.
3. **Turn on Grid** (Settings > Camera > toggle on Grid). The grid lines help you center your subject.
4. **Lock focus and exposure.** When filming, tap and hold on the subject's face until you see "AE/AF Lock" appear at the top of the screen. This prevents the camera from refocusing or changing brightness while recording.
5. **Use the back camera, not the front (selfie) camera.** The back camera is significantly sharper. If Dr. Vel is filming alone, set up the phone on a tripod facing him and use a Bluetooth remote or the phone's timer to start recording.
6. **Turn on Airplane Mode** before recording. This prevents phone calls, texts, and notifications from interrupting your take.

### Professional Equipment Options (If Hiring a Videographer)

If you hire a videographer for any session, share this section with them:

- **Camera:** Any mirrorless or DSLR shooting 4K/30fps minimum. Sony A7 series, Canon R series, or Fujifilm X-T series are all common choices.
- **Lens:** 35mm or 50mm prime lens for talking-head segments (flattering compression, shallow depth of field). 16-35mm zoom for establishing shots of the clinic.
- **Audio:** Wireless lavalier mic system (Rode Wireless Go or similar) plus a shotgun mic on camera as backup.
- **Lighting:** Two LED panels with diffusion. One as key light (main light on the subject), one as fill light (softer, from the other side). A small LED for hair/separation light is a bonus.
- **Stabilization:** Tripod for talking heads. Gimbal (DJI RS series or similar) for walkthrough/follow shots.

## Part 2: Technical Requirements by Platform

Every platform has different size and shape requirements. Here is what you need for each.

### Video Formats

| Platform | Orientation | Resolution | Aspect Ratio | Max Length | File Format |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| YouTube (main video) | Horizontal (landscape) | 1920x1080 or 3840x2160 | 16:9 | 15 minutes (for our content) | MP4 (H.264) |
| YouTube Shorts | Vertical (portrait) | 1080x1920 | 9:16 | 60 seconds | MP4 |
| Facebook Feed | Horizontal or Square | 1920x1080 or 1080x1080 | 16:9 or 1:1 | 240 minutes (keep under 3 min) | MP4 |
| Facebook Stories | Vertical | 1080x1920 | 9:16 | 20 seconds per story | MP4 |
| Instagram Reels | Vertical | 1080x1920 | 9:16 | 90 seconds | MP4 |
| Instagram Feed | Square or Vertical | 1080x1080 or 1080x1350 | 1:1 or 4:5 | 60 seconds | MP4 |
| Instagram Stories | Vertical | 1080x1920 | 9:16 | 15 seconds per story | MP4 |

**What this means in practice:** Film everything in 16:9 horizontal (the standard wide rectangle). Your editor can crop to 9:16 vertical and 1:1 square from the same footage. Just make sure the subject is centered in the frame so nothing important gets cut off when cropping.

### Photo/Image Formats

| Platform | Orientation | Resolution | Aspect Ratio |
|---|---|---|---|
| Instagram Feed | Square | 1080x1080 | 1:1 |
| Instagram Stories | Vertical | 1080x1920 | 9:16 |
| Facebook Feed | Landscape | 1200x628 | ~1.91:1 |
| Facebook Stories | Vertical | 1080x1920 | 9:16 |
| Google Business Profile | Landscape | 720x720 minimum | 1:1 or 16:9 |
| YouTube Thumbnail | Landscape | 1280x720 | 16:9 |

**Tip:** Shoot all photos at the highest resolution your phone allows. You can always shrink a large image, but you cannot make a small image larger without losing quality.

### Graphic/Carousel Formats

| Platform | Slide Size | Aspect Ratio | Max Slides |
|---|---|---|---|
| Instagram Carousel | 1080x1080 | 1:1 | 10 slides |
| Facebook Carousel | 1080x1080 | 1:1 | 10 slides |
| Instagram Stories | 1080x1920 | 9:16 | Multiple story frames |

## Part 3: Lighting Tips for the Clinic

Lighting is the single biggest factor in whether your content looks professional or amateur. Good lighting makes everything look better — skin tones, the treatment room, the products on the shelf. Bad lighting makes even an expensive camera look cheap.

### Natural Light (Your Best Free Resource)

- **Film near windows whenever possible.** Position the subject (Dr. Vel or the patient) facing the window so the natural light falls on their face. The camera should be between the window and the subject.
- **Never film with the window behind the subject.** This creates a silhouette — the person looks dark and the background looks blown out.
- **Best times to film indoors:** Mid-morning (9-11 AM) or mid-afternoon (2-4 PM), when sunlight is soft and indirect. Avoid direct midday sun streaming through windows — it creates harsh shadows.
- **Overcast days are ideal.** Cloud cover acts as a giant diffuser, creating soft, even light throughout the clinic.

### Artificial Light (When Natural Light Is Not Enough)

- **Turn off overhead fluorescent lights.** Fluorescent lights create an unflattering green-blue cast and cause flickering on camera. If the room has overhead fluorescents, turn them off and use your LED panel(s) instead.
- **Position your LED panel at a 45-degree angle** from the subject, slightly above eye level. This mimics natural window light and creates subtle, flattering shadows.
- **Set your LED panel to warm-white** (around 4000K-4500K on the dial or app). This matches the warm, professional tone of the brand. Avoid cool blue light (5500K+) — it looks clinical and sterile.
- **If you have two LED panels:** Place the main light (key light) at 45 degrees on one side and the second light (fill light) at 45 degrees on the other side, but set it dimmer (about half brightness). This fills in shadows without making the lighting look flat.
- **Avoid mixing light sources.** If the window light is warm and your LED is cool, the colors will look off. Match your LED temperature to whatever ambient light is in the room.

### Clinical Environment Specifics

- **Treatment room:** The treatment table area benefits from warm, soft overhead or side lighting. If the room has adjustable dimmer switches, use them to reduce overhead intensity. Supplement with an LED panel placed out of frame.
- **Waiting area:** Use the natural light from the front windows. If filming in the evening, turn on warm-tone lamps and turn off any fluorescent overheads.
- **Needle close-ups:** Use a well-lit, neutral background. A small LED panel pointed at the treatment area from above and to the side gives clean, shadow-free illumination.

## Part 4: Audio Tips

Poor audio ruins good video faster than anything else. Viewers will tolerate slightly imperfect visuals, but if they cannot clearly hear what is being said, they will scroll past.

### Rules for Good Audio

1. **Always use an external microphone.** The built-in phone mic picks up echo, air conditioning, and room noise. A $15 clip-on lavalier mic will transform your audio quality.
2. **Clip the lavalier mic about 6-8 inches below the chin,** on a shirt collar, lapel, or neckline. Make sure it is not rubbing against fabric or jewelry.
3. **Turn off the HVAC system** (heating/air conditioning) in the room before recording. The hum is barely noticeable in person but very audible on a recording.
4. **Close doors and windows** to reduce outside noise — traffic, hallway conversations, other patients.
5. **Record a 10-second "room tone" clip** at the start of each session (just silence in the room). Your editor can use this to smooth out any audio gaps.
6. **Do a test recording.** Before the real take, record 15 seconds and play it back with headphones. Listen for echo, hum, or anything distracting. Fix it now — not in editing.

### Music

- Background music will be added in editing, not recorded live.
- The creative briefs specify acoustic, understated music. Your editor should source royalty-free tracks from sites like Artlist, Epidemic Sound, or YouTube's free Audio Library.
- Music should sit well below the speaking voice — it is atmosphere, not a soundtrack.

## Part 5: Quality Checklist

Print this page and check it before every filming session.

### Before You Start Filming

- [ ] Phone charged above 80% (video recording drains battery fast)
- [ ] Phone storage has at least 10 GB free (4K video uses about 400 MB per minute)
- [ ] Airplane Mode turned on
- [ ] Camera set to 4K / 30fps
- [ ] HDR Video turned off
- [ ] Grid turned on
- [ ] Tripod set up and level (use the grid lines to check — horizon should be straight)
- [ ] External microphone connected and tested (record 15 seconds, play back with headphones)
- [ ] Lighting set up — LED panels on, fluorescent overheads off
- [ ] HVAC turned off in the recording room
- [ ] Background checked — no clutter, no personal items, no distracting objects visible
- [ ] Subject (Dr. Vel, patient) wearing appropriate attire (professional, no busy patterns or logos)
- [ ] Patient consent form signed (if a patient appears on camera)

### During Filming

- [ ] Focus locked on the subject's face (tap and hold to lock)
- [ ] Subject is centered in the frame (leave a little space above the head)
- [ ] Record at least 5 seconds of stillness before and after each take (gives editing room)
- [ ] Capture at least 2-3 takes of each talking segment (you can pick the best one later)
- [ ] For b-roll shots, hold each shot for at least 10 seconds (short clips are hard to edit)
- [ ] Check the recording every few takes — make sure the image is sharp and audio is clear

### After Filming

- [ ] Watch one full take to verify video and audio quality before packing up
- [ ] Transfer all files to a computer or cloud drive the same day (do not rely on phone storage alone)
- [ ] Label the files clearly: "Brief01_PatriciaTestimonial_Take3.mp4" — not "IMG_4392.MOV"
- [ ] Back up to a second location (Google Drive, Dropbox, external hard drive)
- [ ] Turn HVAC back on

## Part 6: Common Mistakes to Avoid

These are the errors that most frequently ruin otherwise good footage. Every one of them is preventable.

**1. Filming in portrait (vertical) when you need landscape, or vice versa.**
Check the shot list before pressing record. YouTube needs horizontal. Reels need vertical. When in doubt, film horizontal — it can be cropped to vertical, but vertical cannot be cropped to horizontal without losing most of the frame.

**2. Using the selfie (front) camera.**
The front camera is lower resolution and produces a softer, less detailed image. Always use the back camera. Use a tripod and position check, or have someone else monitor the frame.

**3. Forgetting the microphone.**
Built-in phone audio sounds hollow and distant. If you start recording and realize you forgot to plug in the lavalier mic, stop and start over. Do not try to fix bad audio in editing.

**4. Filming under overhead fluorescent lights.**
These create a green color cast and visible flickering in video. Turn them off. Use your LED panels and any available window light instead.

**5. Shaky handheld footage.**
For talking-head segments (Dr. Vel speaking to camera, patient testimonials), always use a tripod. Handheld is only acceptable for brief b-roll clips where a slight natural motion adds to the organic feel.

**6. Cluttered or distracting backgrounds.**
Before hitting record, look at the entire frame — not just the subject. Is there a trash can visible? A coat hanging on a door? A whiteboard with patient notes? Remove or reposition anything that distracts from the subject.

**7. Recording for too short a duration.**
Every clip should be at least 10 seconds, even if you only need 3 seconds of it. Longer clips give your editor flexibility. For talking segments, always do at least 2 takes.

**8. Not checking audio before a full session.**
Record 15 seconds, play it back with headphones. If the audio is echoey, muffled, or picks up HVAC hum, fix the issue before proceeding. Discovering bad audio after a 30-minute interview is demoralizing.

**9. Inconsistent lighting between shots.**
If you film Dr. Vel's talking head at 10 AM with warm window light, then film b-roll at 3 PM with different lighting, the footage will not match when edited together. Try to film all segments for a single video within the same lighting conditions.

**10. Not getting patient consent on camera.**
Before filming any patient, have them sign a media release form. Keep these forms on file. Do not assume verbal permission is enough — protect yourself and your patients.

## Part 7: Quick-Reference Filming Setups

### Setup A: Talking Head (Dr. Vel speaking to camera)
- Tripod with phone at eye level, 3-4 feet from subject
- Subject seated or standing, facing the camera
- LED panel at 45 degrees, slightly above eye level, on the left or right
- Lavalier mic clipped to collar
- Background: treatment room or consultation desk, slightly out of focus
- Film in 16:9 horizontal

### Setup B: Patient Testimonial
- Same as Setup A, but the patient is the subject
- Dr. Vel can sit just off-camera to the left or right of the lens — the patient looks at Dr. Vel while speaking, which creates a natural, conversational eye line slightly off-center
- Alternatively, the patient can speak directly to the camera lens
- Have tissues available (emotional stories are common)

### Setup C: Treatment / B-Roll
- Tripod or handheld (steady hands required)
- Close-up shots: Dr. Vel's hands placing needles, checking pulse, pointing to anatomical chart
- Wide shots: full treatment room, patient resting comfortably
- No audio needed (music and voiceover will be added in editing)
- Film in 16:9 horizontal for maximum flexibility

### Setup D: Clinic Walkthrough
- Gimbal (preferred) or very steady handheld
- Follow Dr. Vel as he walks through the clinic from waiting area to consultation to treatment room
- Wireless lavalier mic on Dr. Vel so he can narrate while walking
- Film in 16:9 horizontal (will be cropped to 9:16 for Reels)
- Walk slowly and smoothly — rushing creates unusable footage

### Setup E: Outdoor / Lifestyle B-Roll
- Handheld or gimbal
- Natural light only — no LEDs needed outdoors
- Film during golden hour (1-2 hours before sunset) for warm, flattering light
- Subjects: patients doing everyday activities (gardening, walking, cooking)
- No audio needed
- Film in 16:9 horizontal
