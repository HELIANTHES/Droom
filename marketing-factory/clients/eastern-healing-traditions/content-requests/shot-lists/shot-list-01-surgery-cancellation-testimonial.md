## Scene 1: Patricia Testimonial — Talking Head

**Setup:** Setup B (Patient Testimonial) from the Filming Guide

| Shot | Description | Subject | Camera | Angle / Framing | Duration | Lighting | Props / Wardrobe | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1A | Patricia introduces herself and describes her shoulder pain — how long she has had it, how it limited her life | Patricia J. seated in treatment room | Tripod, locked | Medium close-up (head and shoulders), slightly off-center. Shallow depth of field (portrait mode if using iPhone). | 60-90s of usable footage (film 3-4 minutes; best segments will be selected in editing) | LED panel at 45 degrees camera-left, slightly above eye level. Warm-white (4000-4500K). Overhead fluorescents OFF. Natural window light from behind camera if available. | Patricia in a comfortable, casual top — solid color, no busy patterns or logos. A teal or earth-tone throw pillow on the chair or nearby shelf to anchor brand colors. | Dr. Vel sits just off-camera to the right of the lens. Patricia looks at Dr. Vel while speaking — this creates a natural, warm conversational eye line. Do not have her read from a script. Ask her to tell the story in her own words. |
| 1B | Patricia describes the moment her doctor recommended surgery — her feelings, fear, reluctance | Same as 1A | Same as 1A | Same as 1A — slow push-in begins here if using a slider or digital zoom | 30-45s | Same as 1A | Same as 1A | This is the emotional turning point. Let her take her time. Do not rush. |
| 1C | Patricia describes her skepticism about acupuncture, then what happened after 3 sessions — the surgery cancellation moment | Same as 1A | Same as 1A | Continue slow push-in to tighter close-up during the "I canceled my surgery" line | 45-60s | Same as 1A | Same as 1A | This is the climax of the story. Film at least 3 takes of this segment. The best delivery will be used. If she says it differently each time, capture all versions. |
| 1D | Patricia describes her sciatica relief — 95% improvement in 5 sessions. Her recommendation to viewers. | Same as 1A | Same as 1A | Return to medium close-up | 30-45s | Same as 1A | Same as 1A | End on a genuine, personal note. "If you're where I was, just try it." |

## Scene 2: Dr. Vel — Brief Educational Moment

**Setup:** Setup A (Talking Head) from the Filming Guide

| Shot | Description | Subject | Camera | Angle / Framing | Duration | Lighting | Props / Wardrobe | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2A | Dr. Vel provides a brief, accessible explanation of how acupuncture addresses inflammation and nerve signaling in shoulder conditions | Dr. Vel seated or standing in the treatment room | Tripod, locked | Medium close-up, centered or slightly off-center | 20-30s of usable footage (film 60-90s, select best segment) | Same LED setup as Scene 1. Reposition light if Dr. Vel is in a different spot. | Dr. Vel in professional clinical attire — collared shirt or medical-professional top. No lab coat unless he typically wears one. | Keep it to 2-3 sentences maximum. This is a supporting moment, not a lecture. Example: "What we do with acupuncture is modulate the body's pain signaling and reduce the inflammatory response at the source. For Patricia, that meant addressing the shoulder and the sciatic nerve simultaneously." |

## Scene 3: Treatment B-Roll

**Setup:** Setup C (Treatment / B-Roll) from the Filming Guide

| Shot | Description | Subject | Camera | Angle / Framing | Duration | Lighting | Props / Wardrobe | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 3A | Close-up of Dr. Vel's hands selecting an acupuncture needle from the tray | Dr. Vel's hands, needle tray | Tripod or steady handheld | Close-up, overhead or 45-degree angle looking down at the tray | Hold for 10-15s | LED panel angled to illuminate the tray without harsh shadows. Gold-toned items nearby if possible (branded tray liner, wooden surface). | Gloves if standard practice. Needles in their sterile packaging visible. | Show the precision and care. Slow, deliberate hand movements. |
| 3B | Close-up of Dr. Vel placing a needle — shot from the side, showing both hands and the patient's shoulder area | Dr. Vel's hands, patient's shoulder | Tripod, locked | Close-up from the side. Shallow depth of field so the background is soft. | Hold for 10-15s | Same as 3A. Make sure the needle is well-lit and visible against the skin. | Same as 3A. | Film from far enough away that the needle placement looks gentle and routine, not invasive. The patient should appear calm and relaxed. Do NOT film an extreme macro of the needle tip entering skin. |
| 3C | Medium shot of patient resting with needles placed, eyes closed, calm expression | Patient (Patricia or stand-in) | Tripod, locked | Medium shot, slightly above the patient looking down at a gentle angle | Hold for 10-15s | Soft, warm ambient light. LED panel dimmed to create a restful atmosphere. | Patient covered with a clean blanket or sheet. Treatment room tidy and professional. | This shot communicates comfort and safety. The patient should look genuinely relaxed. |
| 3D | Wide establishing shot of the treatment room — clean, professional, well-lit | Treatment room (no people, or patient in background) | Tripod, locked | Wide shot from the doorway or corner, capturing the full room | Hold for 10-15s | All room lighting on (warm-toned). LED panel providing fill light. | Room should be spotless. Any brand-colored elements (teal throw, gold accents, framed credentials) visible. | This establishes the clinical environment as modern and welcoming. |

Film during golden hour if possible. | Patricia in casual clothing, gardening gloves. Real garden or patio setting. | The point is to show her moving freely and without pain. No exaggerated "look how great I feel" posing — natural, authentic activity. |
| 4B | Patricia carrying grocery bags from her car into the house — using both arms without hesitation | Patricia at her home or a parking lot | Handheld or gimbal | Medium-wide shot, eye level | Hold for 10-15s | Natural light | Grocery bags (can be props — they just need to look real) | Casual, everyday activity that would have been painful before treatment. |
| 4C | Patricia walking outdoors — full body, confident stride | Patricia on a walking path, sidewalk, or park | Gimbal follow shot or locked tripod with Patricia walking toward camera | Full body or medium-wide, eye level | 10-15s | Natural light | Comfortable walking clothes | She walks toward the camera with a natural, easy stride. No slow-motion needed unless the editor requests it. |

## Notes for the Videographer

- Patricia's comfort is the top priority. Allow her to settle in and warm up before the "real" take. Chat casually for a few minutes first.
- Do not script her words. Ask her to tell her story as if she is telling a friend. Prompt with questions if needed: "What was the pain like before?", "What did you think when the doctor said surgery?", "What happened after the third session?"
- Capture at least 3 takes of the key moments (surgery cancellation, recommendation). Different phrasing gives the editor options.
- The slow push-in during the "I canceled my surgery" moment should be subtle — no more than a 10-15% zoom over 15 seconds. If you cannot do this smoothly, stay on the locked tripod. A bad push-in is worse than no push-in.
- Film all clinic scenes before moving to the lifestyle location to avoid re-setting up at the clinic.
