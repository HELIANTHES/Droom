## Scene 1: Lifestyle Portrait — Relief and Calm

**Setup:** Natural light portrait, indoor or outdoor

| Shot | Description | Subject | Camera | Angle / Framing | Duration | Lighting | Props / Wardrobe | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1A | Woman in her 40s-50s with a calm, relieved, hopeful expression. Not smiling broadly — more of a settled, peaceful look. | Female patient volunteer or model (40s-50s) | Tripod or handheld | Medium close-up (head and shoulders). Shallow depth of field (portrait mode). | Capture 10-15 photos, varying slight head angles and expressions | Natural window light or outdoor shade. Warm tones. No flash. | Subject in a comfortable, solid-colored top — sage green, soft blue, cream, or warm neutral. No logos, no busy patterns. Hair natural. Minimal jewelry. | This image will be used on Slide 1 or Slide 8 of the carousel. The expression should communicate "I finally feel understood" — not "I'm cured" and not "I'm in pain." Subtle and genuine. |
| 1B | Same subject, wider shot — seated on a couch, in a garden, or at a kitchen table. Body language is open and relaxed. | Same as 1A | Tripod or handheld | Medium-wide shot (waist up). Environment visible in background. | Capture 8-10 photos | Same natural light as 1A | Same as 1A. If indoors, the setting should feel warm and lived-in — not staged. | This provides an alternative crop or a lifestyle context image for the carousel or the Facebook single-image ad. |

## Scene 2: Clinical Detail Shots

**Setup:** Setup C (Treatment / B-Roll) from the Filming Guide — clinic treatment room

| Shot | Description | Subject | Camera | Angle / Framing | Duration | Lighting | Props / Wardrobe | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2A | Dr. Vel's hands placing acupuncture needles on upper back / shoulder area — the region commonly affected by fibromyalgia trigger points | Dr. Vel's hands, patient's upper back | Tripod or steady handheld | Close-up from the side. Show both hands and a few inches of the patient's back/shoulder. | Capture 8-10 photos from slightly different angles | LED panel from above-left, angled down at 45 degrees. Warm-white. Overheads off. | Dr. Vel in professional attire. Patient in a sleeveless or open-back top allowing access to the upper back. Clean treatment table. | The needles should be visible but not dominating the frame. The emphasis is on Dr. Vel's hands — precision and care. This will be used on Slide 5 or 6 to illustrate "acupuncture's effect on the nervous system." |
| 2B | Close-up of Chinese herbal medicine preparation — loose herbs, a mortar and pestle, or pre-packaged herbal formulas arranged neatly | Herbal medicine display | Tripod, directly above (flat-lay) or at 45-degree angle | Close-up. Clean, well-composed arrangement. | Capture 8-10 photos varying arrangement and angle | LED panel providing even, soft light across the surface. No harsh shadows. | Herbs, containers, measuring tools. A small branded element (teal-colored cloth or gold accent) beneath or beside the herbs. | This image illustrates Slide 6: "Chinese herbal formulas that address root patterns." The arrangement should look professional and clinical — not mystical or exotic. Think pharmacy, not apothecary. |
| 2C | A selection of anti-inflammatory foods arranged on a clean surface — turmeric, ginger, leafy greens, salmon, berries | Food arrangement | Tripod, overhead flat-lay | Top-down flat-lay or 45-degree angle | Capture 6-8 photos | Natural window light or LED panel. Bright, clean illumination. | Clean cutting board or white/light surface. Fresh, vibrant produce. No packaging. | This illustrates Slide 7: "Eastern nutrition adjustments." The food should look appetizing and accessible — everyday ingredients, not exotic items. |

## Notes for the Photographer

- The lifestyle portraits (Scene 1) should feel real. Avoid posing the subject stiffly. Have her sit naturally and talk to her while shooting — candid-feeling photos are more authentic than posed ones.
- For the clinical detail shots (Scene 2), cleanliness is paramount. Wipe down surfaces, arrange tools neatly, and remove anything extraneous from the frame.
- The flat-lay food arrangement (Shot 2C) takes longer than you might expect. Arrange the items, shoot, rearrange slightly, shoot again. The designer needs options.
- All photos should be delivered in full resolution, unedited (no filters, no crops). The designer will handle color grading to match the brand palette.
