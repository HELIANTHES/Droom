# Shot List 04: DACM Credential Authority

**Brief:** 04 — DACM Credential Authority
**Deliverables:** Instagram/Facebook carousel (6-8 slides, 1080x1080) + Facebook single-image ad (1200x628)
**Filming Location:** Eastern Healing Traditions clinic, Grayslake, IL
**Estimated Filming Time:** 45 minutes to 1 hour (photo only)

This brief is primarily graphic design (text-forward carousel slides), but it requires specific professional photographs of Dr. Vel. These shots should be captured during the Week 1 filming session alongside Brief 01 to minimize setup changes.

## Scene 1: Professional Headshot

**Setup:** Setup A (Talking Head) from the Filming Guide, adapted for still photography

| Shot | Description | Subject | Camera | Angle / Framing | Duration | Lighting | Props / Wardrobe | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1A | Professional headshot — Dr. Vel facing camera with a warm, confident expression. Not a stiff corporate headshot — approachable and authoritative. | Dr. Vel | Tripod, phone in portrait mode (for shallow depth of field) | Head and shoulders, centered. Leave space above the head for text overlay in graphics. | Capture 15-20 photos, varying slight expression and head tilt | LED panel at 45 degrees camera-left, slightly above eye level. Second LED panel at 45 degrees camera-right at half brightness (fill light). Warm-white (4000-4500K). Fluorescent overheads OFF. | Dr. Vel in a clean, professional collared shirt — deep teal, navy, or charcoal gray. No lab coat unless that is his standard clinical attire. No tie required. Top button open is fine. | Background: the treatment room or consultation area, blurred out of focus. Ideally, a framed diploma or credential is faintly visible on the wall behind him — not readable, just present as a visual cue. No clutter. The expression should be "I'm glad you're here" — warm confidence, not a grin and not a stern medical face. |
| 1B | Professional headshot — slight three-quarter turn (face turned 15-20 degrees to one side) | Same as 1A | Same as 1A | Head and shoulders, slightly off-center with face turned | Capture 10-15 photos | Same as 1A | Same as 1A | This variation gives the designer options. The three-quarter angle adds dimension and can feel more dynamic in a carousel slide. |

## Scene 2: Dr. Vel in Clinical Context

**Setup:** Natural interaction shots in different clinic areas

| Shot | Description | Subject | Camera | Angle / Framing | Duration | Lighting | Props / Wardrobe | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2A | Dr. Vel in consultation — seated at his desk, leaning slightly forward as if listening to a patient (patient not in frame or only partially visible) | Dr. Vel at consultation desk | Tripod or handheld | Medium shot, slightly off-center. Desk, notepad, and clinical references visible. | Capture 10-12 photos | LED panel plus natural window light. Warm tones. | Same professional attire. Desk clean and organized — intake form, pen, anatomical reference. | This image communicates "he listens." The body language should be attentive and engaged — not reclined, not distracted. |
| 2B | Dr. Vel standing beside the treatment table, arms relaxed at sides or one hand on the table, looking at camera with composed confidence | Dr. Vel beside treatment table | Tripod or handheld | Three-quarter body (waist up). Treatment table clean and prepared in the background. | Capture 8-10 photos | LED panel providing even illumination. The treatment room should look bright and professional. | Same professional attire. Treatment table with clean linens. | This is a "meet your practitioner" image. Confident posture, approachable expression. Could be used as the Facebook ad image with text overlay. |
| 2C | Close-up of Dr. Vel's DACM diploma or credential certificate on the wall | Diploma/credential on wall | Tripod or handheld | Close-up, straight-on. The text on the diploma should be readable. | Capture 5-8 photos, varying the amount of surrounding wall visible | LED panel or natural light illuminating the frame evenly. No glare on the glass. | Frame clean, wall surrounding it clean and neutral. | If the diploma is behind glass, position the light at an angle to avoid reflection. If glare is unavoidable, consider removing the glass for the photo and replacing it afterward. |

## Scene 3: Treatment Modalities Display

**Setup:** Product/tool arrangement shots

| Shot | Description | Subject | Camera | Angle / Framing | Duration | Lighting | Props / Wardrobe | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 3A | An arranged display of tools or items representing the 7 modalities: acupuncture needles, herbal medicine containers, cupping cups, moxibustion stick, gua sha tool, electroacupuncture device, nutritional reference or food items | Treatment tools arranged on a clean surface | Tripod, overhead (flat-lay) or 45-degree angle | Wide enough to capture all items with space between them. Clean, uncluttered composition. | Capture 10-15 photos varying arrangement | LED panel(s) providing bright, even, shadow-free illumination from above. A white or light wood surface underneath. | All tools clean and presentable. Arrange in a deliberate pattern — perhaps a row, a circle, or grouped logically. A small label or branded card next to each item identifying the modality. | This image could be used on Slide 6 of the carousel: "7 modalities Dr. Vel offers." Each tool should be recognizable and non-threatening. Cupping cups can be glass or silicone. Needles should be in their sterile packaging (not loose). |

## Notes for the Photographer

- Dr. Vel's expression is everything in this shoot. Spend time putting him at ease before the headshot. Have a conversation, tell a joke, ask him about a recent patient success. The best headshots happen when the subject forgets they are being photographed.
- Capture both vertical and horizontal orientations of the headshot for maximum flexibility in graphic design.
- For the diploma shot (2C): if the diploma is in a location with poor lighting or a cluttered background, consider temporarily moving it to a well-lit wall or propping it on an easel.
- The modality tools display (3A) should be art-directed carefully. Lay everything out, step back, evaluate, and rearrange until it looks clean and intentional. This is a flat-lay — treat it like a food photograph. Every element should be placed with purpose.
- All photos should be delivered at full resolution, unedited. The designer will crop, color-grade, and compose.
- This shoot pairs naturally with Brief 01 (Patricia's testimonial) — capture the headshot and clinical context shots while the lighting and treatment room setup are already in place.
