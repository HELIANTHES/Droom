## Scene 1: Exterior and Arrival

**Setup:** Handheld or gimbal, outdoor natural light

| Shot | Description | Subject | Camera | Angle / Framing | Duration | Lighting | Props / Wardrobe | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1A | Exterior of the clinic building — the sign, the entrance, the parking area. Clean, welcoming. | Building exterior | Tripod or steady handheld | Wide establishing shot. Capture the full facade. | Hold for 10-15s | Natural daylight. Film on a clear or lightly overcast day for even light. | Ensure the sign is clean, entrance is tidy, and any landscaping looks maintained. | This is the first image viewers see. It should say "professional medical practice." Remove any trash, stray signage, or clutter from the exterior. |
| 1B | The front door opening — Dr. Vel welcomes the camera (the viewer) inside. Direct address: "Come on in — let me show you what to expect." | Dr. Vel at the front door | Gimbal or steady handheld | Medium shot, eye level. Camera is outside, Dr. Vel stands in the doorway. | 10-15s | Natural light outdoors, warm indoor light visible through the doorway | Dr. Vel in professional attire (same outfit for the entire shoot). | Dr. Vel speaks directly to the camera as if the viewer is the patient arriving for their first visit. Warm, reassuring tone. |

**Setup:** Gimbal follow shot transitioning to tripod

| Shot | Description | Subject | Camera | Angle / Framing | Duration | Lighting | Props / Wardrobe | Notes |

| 2A | Dr. Vel walks the viewer into the waiting area. Follow shot from behind, then orbiting around to face him as he gestures to the space. | Dr. Vel in waiting area | Gimbal (preferred) or very steady handheld | Medium-wide shot, following behind then rotating to face him | 15-20s | Natural window light supplemented with LED panel if needed. Warm tones. Overheads off if fluorescent. | Waiting area clean and inviting — magazines current, seating arranged neatly, any brand-colored accents visible (teal throw pillows, framed credentials on wall). | Dr. Vel narrates: "This is where your visit starts. You'll fill out a short health history form so I can understand the full picture before we sit down together." |
| 2B | Wide establishing shot of the entire waiting area — no people, just the space | Waiting area | Tripod, locked | Wide shot from one corner, capturing the full room | Hold for 10-15s | Same as 2A | Same as 2A | This clean shot is used as a transition in editing and can double as a Google Business Profile photo. |

## Scene 3: Consultation / Intake

**Setup:** Setup A (Talking Head) + over-the-shoulder shots

| Shot | Description | Subject | Camera | Angle / Framing | Duration | Lighting | Props / Wardrobe | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 3A | Dr. Vel seated at his consultation desk, explaining the intake process directly to camera | Dr. Vel at desk | Tripod, locked | Medium close-up (head and shoulders). Desk, papers, and an anatomical chart or reference book visible in the blurred background. | 30-45s of usable footage | LED panel at 45 degrees camera-left. Warm-white. Window light if available. Overheads off. | Desk tidy. A notepad, pen, and intake form visible. An anatomical poster or TCM chart on the wall behind him (not centered — off to the side in the background). | Dr. Vel explains: "We start with a thorough conversation about your health history — not just the symptom that brought you in, but the full picture. Digestion, sleep, stress, energy, medications. I need to understand how your body is working as a whole." |
| 3B | Over-the-shoulder shot — camera behind a patient (or stand-in), looking at Dr. Vel across the desk. Dr. Vel is reviewing the intake form and asking questions. | Dr. Vel and patient at desk | Tripod or handheld on shoulder | Over-the-shoulder, medium shot. The patient's shoulder and back of head are visible in the foreground, Dr. Vel is in focus in the background. | 15-20s | Same as 3A | Same as 3A. Patient in a solid-colored top. | This shot shows the relationship — Dr. Vel listening and engaging with the patient. Capture Dr. Vel nodding, writing notes, and making eye contact. No scripted dialogue needed — just natural interaction. |
| 3C | Close-up of Dr. Vel's hands reviewing the intake form, writing notes | Dr. Vel's hands on paperwork | Tripod, locked | Close-up, overhead or 45-degree downward angle | Hold for 10-15s | LED panel from above to illuminate the paper evenly | Intake form (can be blank or a sample — no real patient data visible).

## Scene 4: Tongue and Pulse Diagnosis

**Setup:** Close-up detail shots + talking head

| Shot | Description | Subject | Camera | Angle / Framing | Duration | Lighting | Props / Wardrobe | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 4A | Dr. Vel explains tongue and pulse diagnosis to camera — what it is, why it matters, what it tells him | Dr. Vel at consultation desk or standing | Tripod, locked | Medium close-up | 30-45s usable | Same LED setup | Same professional attire | Script guidance: "In Chinese medicine, the tongue and pulse tell us things that lab work doesn't always catch. The color, coating, and shape of the tongue reflect what's happening in your digestive system, circulation, and immune function. The pulse — I'm checking the quality, not just the rate — tells me about the state of your organs." Keep it accessible and genuinely interesting. |
| 4B | Close-up of Dr. Vel taking the patient's pulse — three fingers on the wrist, focused expression | Dr. Vel's hand on patient's wrist | Tripod or steady handheld | Close-up. Dr. Vel's three fingers on the patient's inner wrist. Patient's hand resting on a small pillow or flat on the table. | Hold for 10-15s | LED panel illuminating both hands. Warm light. | Clean hands. Patient's wrist clear of watches or bracelets. A small cushion or folded cloth under the wrist. | This is a signature TCM image. Frame it carefully — show the precision of three-finger placement. Dr. Vel's expression should be focused and attentive. |
| 4C | Medium shot of patient sticking out their tongue while Dr. Vel examines it. Brief, clinical, not comical. | Dr. Vel and patient | Tripod, locked | Medium shot showing both Dr. Vel and the patient in profile or three-quarter view | Hold for 8-10s | LED panel providing even light on both subjects | Same as above | Keep this shot brief and dignified. The patient should not look silly. A quick, matter-of-fact tongue presentation — the same way a doctor would examine your throat. Dr. Vel can lean in slightly and nod thoughtfully. |

## Scene 5: Treatment Plan Explanation

**Setup:** Setup A (Talking Head)

| Shot | Description | Subject | Camera | Angle / Framing | Duration | Lighting | Props / Wardrobe | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 5A | Dr. Vel explains the treatment plan process to camera — how he decides which modalities to use, how he explains the plan to the patient | Dr. Vel, possibly near an anatomical chart or whiteboard | Tripod, locked | Medium close-up | 20-30s usable | Same LED setup | Same professional attire. An anatomical chart, spine model, or TCM reference visual on the wall or desk. | Script guidance: "Based on everything I've gathered, I explain exactly what I've found and which modalities I recommend. I walk you through why I'm choosing acupuncture for this area, why an herbal formula will support what the needles are doing, and what you can expect in terms of timeline. You should never leave wondering what happened or why." |
| 5B | Dr. Vel pointing to a specific area on an anatomical chart or spine model while explaining to the patient | Dr. Vel and chart/model | Tripod, locked | Medium shot. Dr. Vel in profile pointing to the chart. Chart detail visible. | Hold for 10-15s | LED panel illuminating the chart evenly | Anatomical chart or spine model. | This communicates education and transparency. Dr. Vel is teaching the patient about their own body. |

## Scene 6: Needle Placement

**Setup:** Setup C (Treatment / B-Roll) — treatment room

| Shot | Description | Subject | Camera | Angle / Framing | Duration | Lighting | Props / Wardrobe | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 6A | Dr. Vel narrates to camera: "Now for the part everyone asks about — the needles." He holds up a needle next to something for scale. | Dr. Vel holding a needle next to a penny, a strand of hair, or a standard ballpoint pen tip | Tripod, locked | Medium close-up of Dr. Vel, then cut to a close-up insert of the comparison | 15-20s | LED panel, bright and even | One acupuncture needle (in packaging, then removed). A penny, a strand of hair on white paper, or a pen for comparison. | Script guidance: "This is an acupuncture needle. See how thin it is compared to [penny/hair]? A standard medical needle — the kind at the doctor's office — is about 10 times thicker. Most patients don't feel this going in at all." This directly addresses needle anxiety. |
| 6B | Wide shot of Dr. Vel approaching the treatment table where the patient is lying face-down, comfortable | Dr. Vel and patient, full treatment room | Tripod, locked | Wide shot from the foot of the table or from the side | Hold for 10-15s | LED panel plus any warm ambient room light. Comfortable, not harsh. | Clean treatment table with fresh linens. Patient in comfortable clothing or draped. Room tidy. | Establishing the scene — the patient looks comfortable, the room looks clean, the environment feels safe. |
| 6C | Medium shot of Dr. Vel placing needles on the patient's upper back. His hands are steady and precise. The patient's expression is calm. | Dr. Vel's hands, patient's back, patient's face visible | Tripod, locked, or very slow handheld orbit | Medium shot from the side. Both Dr. Vel's hands and the patient's face (turned to the side, eyes relaxed or closed) should be in frame. | Hold for 15-20s | LED panel from above-left. Warm. No harsh shadows on the patient's face. | Same as 6B | This is the critical trust-building shot. The patient must look calm and comfortable. If the patient's face shows any tension or discomfort, re-take. Show 2-3 needles being placed in sequence if possible. |
| 6D | Close-up of a placed needle — shallow depth of field, the needle thin and barely visible against the skin | A single needle placed in the upper back or shoulder | Tripod, locked | Close-up, but NOT an extreme macro. Show the needle with 4-6 inches of surrounding skin visible for context. | Hold for 10-15s | LED panel providing clean, even illumination on the area | Clean skin, no distracting marks or clothing | The needle should look small, precise, and non-threatening. If the viewer's reaction is "that's it?", the shot is working. |

| Shot | Description | Subject | Camera | Angle / Framing | Duration | Lighting | Props / Wardrobe | Notes |

He steps back from the table. | Dr. Vel stepping away from the treatment table | Tripod, locked | Medium-wide shot | 8-10s | Dim the LED panel. If the room has a dimmer switch, lower the overhead light. The mood should shift to restful. | Same | Dr. Vel's exit should feel gentle — no abrupt movements. He might adjust a blanket over the patient before leaving. |
| 7B | The patient resting with eyes closed. Calm, peaceful. Perhaps a subtle smile. | Patient on treatment table | Tripod, locked | Medium shot, slightly elevated angle looking down at the patient's face and upper body | Hold for 15-20s | Dim, warm light only. LED panel at minimum or turned off. Natural ambient light. | Blanket covering the patient. Room quiet. | This shot communicates total comfort. Film in silence (no talking, no movement).

Warm-white. | Same professional attire | Script guidance: "After we remove the needles, you might feel deeply relaxed — some patients describe it as the best nap they've had in years. Over the next day or two, you may notice your symptoms shifting. Drink plenty of water, and let me know how you're feeling before your next visit." |
| 8B | Dr. Vel shaking hands with the patient at the front desk or walking them to the door | Dr. Vel and patient | Handheld or tripod | Medium shot | Hold for 8-10s | Natural light near the entrance | Same | A warm, professional goodbye.

Then I check your pulse and tongue — it tells me more than you'd think. Next, the needles. They're thinner than a strand of hair. Most people don't feel them at all. You rest for about 20 minutes — most patients fall asleep. And that's it. No mystery. Book your first visit — link in bio."

## Notes for the Videographer

- This shoot moves through the clinic in sequence. Walk the entire route before filming to identify any areas that need tidying, any lighting issues, or any logistical bottlenecks.
- The patient/stand-in should be someone who is genuinely comfortable with acupuncture. If they look tense or uncertain, it undermines the entire purpose of the video.
- Film all of Dr. Vel's direct-to-camera segments first, room by room, before shooting the b-roll and patient interaction shots. This is more efficient than switching between setups.
- The gimbal shots (1B, 2A) should be practiced as dry runs before recording. Walk the path slowly, keep the camera at chest height, and move smoothly.
- The total shoot is long (3-4 hours). Schedule a break midway. Keep water available for Dr. Vel.
