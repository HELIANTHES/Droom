## Scene 1: Dr. Vel — Hashimoto's Educational Segment (Talking Head)

**Setup:** Setup A (Talking Head) from the Filming Guide

| Shot | Description | Subject | Camera | Angle / Framing | Duration | Lighting | Props / Wardrobe | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1A | Dr. Vel introduces the topic — "Your thyroid levels are 'normal,' but you still feel exhausted." He explains the Hashimoto's gap: medication manages TSH, but many patients still experience fatigue, weight gain, brain fog, hair loss, digestive issues, and anxiety. | Dr. Vel seated at consultation desk | Tripod, locked | Medium close-up (head and shoulders), slightly off-center. Treatment room or consultation area visible in soft-focus background. | 60-90s of usable footage (film 3-4 minutes; best segments will be selected in editing) | LED panel at 45 degrees camera-left, slightly above eye level. Warm-white (4000-4500K). Overhead fluorescents OFF. Natural window light from behind camera if available. | Dr. Vel in professional clinical attire — collared shirt or medical-professional top. Anatomical chart or credential on the wall behind, slightly out of focus. A teal or warm-toned accent element visible in the background. | Dr. Vel speaks directly to camera as if talking to a patient. Conversational, not lecturing. The tone is empathetic — he is speaking to someone who has been told "your labs look fine" while they still feel terrible. |
| 1B | Dr. Vel explains why: Hashimoto's is an autoimmune condition — the immune system is attacking the thyroid. Levothyroxine replaces the hormone but does not address the immune dysregulation. | Same as 1A | Same as 1A | Same as 1A | 30-45s | Same as 1A | Same as 1A | This is the educational pivot. He should explain this in 2-3 sentences of plain language. No jargon without an immediate plain-language translation. Example: "Hashimoto's is not a thyroid problem. It is an immune system problem. The medication replaces the hormone your thyroid cannot make. But it does not stop your immune system from attacking your thyroid in the first place." |
| 1C | Dr. Vel explains the TCM perspective — spleen qi deficiency, kidney yang deficiency, and liver qi stagnation — and maps each one to the symptoms patients actually report (fatigue, cold intolerance, digestive issues, emotional volatility). | Same as 1A | Same as 1A | Same as 1A | 45-60s | Same as 1A | Same as 1A | Use plain language paired with the TCM terms. Example: "In Chinese medicine, what you are describing — the fatigue, the cold hands, the bloating — maps to a pattern we call spleen qi deficiency and kidney yang deficiency. These are not abstract ideas. They describe exactly what is happening in your body." Film at least 3 takes. Different phrasing gives the editor options. |
| 1D | Dr. Vel describes the treatment approach at Eastern Healing Traditions: acupuncture to regulate the immune and endocrine response, Chinese herbal formulas tailored to the individual's pattern, Eastern nutrition protocols to reduce inflammatory triggers. | Same as 1A | Same as 1A | Same as 1A | 30-45s | Same as 1A | Same as 1A | Keep this focused on what the patient receives, not on the theory. "We use acupuncture to calm the immune response, herbal medicine to support the organs that are under strain, and nutrition to remove the triggers that keep the cycle going." |
| 1E | Dr. Vel delivers the closing line: "If your labs say you're fine but your body says otherwise, there's more we can do." Direct, warm, confident. | Same as 1A | Same as 1A | Slow push-in to tighter close-up during this line, if using a slider or digital zoom | 15-20s | Same as 1A | Same as 1A | This is the emotional close of the educational segment. Film at least 3 takes. The best delivery will be used. If the slow push-in cannot be executed smoothly, stay on the locked tripod — a bad push-in is worse than no push-in. |

## Scene 2: Dr. Vel — Voiceover Script Segment

**Setup:** Setup A (Talking Head) from the Filming Guide

| Shot | Description | Subject | Camera | Angle / Framing | Duration | Lighting | Props / Wardrobe | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2A | Dr. Vel delivers the key voiceover script (~45 seconds): "Hashimoto's is not just a thyroid problem. It's an immune system problem. When I see a patient with Hashimoto's, I'm looking at the whole picture — digestion, energy, stress response, sleep. We use acupuncture to calm the immune response, herbal medicine to support the organs that are under strain, and nutrition to remove the triggers that keep the cycle going. The thyroid medication does its job. Our job is everything else." | Dr. Vel seated or standing | Tripod, locked | Medium close-up, centered or slightly off-center | 45s of usable footage (film 2-3 minutes total across takes) | Same as Scene 1 | Same as Scene 1 | This can be recorded in the same session as Scene 1. Film it as both a direct-to-camera delivery and a voiceover recording (audio only, captured with the lavalier mic while the camera rolls on b-roll). The editor will decide which version works best. Film at least 3 full takes. |

## Scene 3: Treatment B-Roll

**Setup:** Setup C (Treatment / B-Roll) from the Filming Guide

| Shot | Description | Subject | Camera | Angle / Framing | Duration | Lighting | Props / Wardrobe | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 3A | Close-up of Dr. Vel's hands selecting an acupuncture needle from the tray | Dr. Vel's hands, needle tray | Tripod or steady handheld | Close-up, overhead or 45-degree angle looking down at the tray | Hold for 10-15s | LED panel angled to illuminate the tray without harsh shadows. Gold-toned items nearby if possible (branded tray liner, wooden surface). | Gloves if standard practice. Needles in their sterile packaging visible. | Show precision and care. Slow, deliberate hand movements. |
| 3B | Close-up of Dr. Vel placing needles along the neck and upper back area — regions relevant to thyroid and immune function | Dr. Vel's hands, patient's neck/upper back | Tripod, locked | Close-up from the side. Shallow depth of field so the background is soft. | Hold for 10-15s | Same as 3A. Make sure the needles are well-lit and visible against the skin. | Same as 3A. | Film from far enough away that the needle placement looks gentle and routine, not invasive. The patient (stand-in or volunteer) should appear calm and relaxed. Do NOT film an extreme macro of the needle tip entering skin. |
| 3C | Dr. Vel checking the patient's pulse — both wrists, attentive expression, listening carefully | Dr. Vel's hands on patient's wrist | Tripod or steady handheld | Close-up of hands and wrists, with Dr. Vel's face partially visible showing concentration | Hold for 10-15s | LED panel providing soft, even illumination on the hands. | Dr. Vel in professional attire. Patient's wrist resting on a small cushion or the edge of the treatment table. | Pulse diagnosis is specific to TCM and visually differentiates Dr. Vel from conventional practitioners. Show both wrists — film each for 10-15 seconds. |
| 3D | Medium shot of patient resting with needles placed, eyes closed, calm expression | Patient (stand-in or volunteer) | Tripod, locked | Medium shot, slightly above the patient looking down at a gentle angle | Hold for 10-15s | Soft, warm ambient light. LED panel dimmed to create a restful atmosphere. | Patient covered with a clean blanket or sheet. Treatment room tidy and professional. | This shot communicates comfort and safety. The patient should look genuinely relaxed. |
| 3E | Close-up of Chinese herbal medicine — loose herbs being measured, pre-packaged formulas, or herbal preparation | Herbal medicine display on clean surface | Tripod, overhead flat-lay or 45-degree angle | Close-up, well-composed arrangement | Hold for 10-15s | LED panel providing even, soft light. No harsh shadows. | Herbs, mortar and pestle, measuring tools. A teal-colored cloth or wooden surface beneath. | The arrangement should look clinical and professional — think pharmacy, not apothecary. This shot illustrates the herbal medicine component of Hashimoto's treatment. |
| 3F | Wide establishing shot of the treatment room — clean, professional, well-lit | Treatment room (no people, or patient resting in background) | Tripod, locked | Wide shot from the doorway or corner, capturing the full room | Hold for 10-15s | All room lighting on (warm-toned). LED panel providing fill light. | Room should be spotless. Any brand-colored elements (teal throw, gold accents, framed credentials) visible. | This establishes the clinical environment as modern and welcoming. |

## Scene 4: Lifestyle B-Roll — Woman Living with Energy

**Setup:** Setup E (Outdoor / Lifestyle B-Roll) from the Filming Guide
**Location:** Kitchen (indoor), park/walking trail (outdoor), or home gym

The lifestyle b-roll represents the composite patient story — a woman in her 30s-40s going about daily life with energy after treatment. This is not a named patient; it is a stand-in or volunteer representing the narrative arc.

| Shot | Description | Subject | Camera | Angle / Framing | Duration | Lighting | Props / Wardrobe | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 4A | Woman cooking in a kitchen — chopping vegetables, stirring a pot, moving around the kitchen with ease and energy | Female stand-in (30s-40s) in a kitchen | Handheld or gimbal, gentle movement | Medium shot, eye level or slightly above | Hold each action for 10-15s, capture 3-4 different cooking actions | Natural light from kitchen windows. Film during daylight hours. If the kitchen has warm-toned lighting, use it. No overhead fluorescents. | Subject in casual, comfortable clothing — a solid-colored top, earth tones or soft blues. Kitchen should be clean and naturally arranged. Real food being prepared (vegetables, fresh ingredients). | The point is to show her functioning with energy and vitality — cooking a real meal, not staged. The food ties into the Eastern nutrition component of the brief. Show anti-inflammatory ingredients if possible (leafy greens, turmeric, ginger, salmon). |
| 4B | Woman exercising — light stretching, yoga mat, resistance bands, or a gentle workout | Same subject | Handheld or gimbal | Medium-wide shot, eye level | Hold for 10-15s per exercise movement, capture 3-4 different movements | Natural light. If indoors, near a window. If outdoors, film during golden hour. | Exercise clothing — simple, solid colors. Yoga mat, light equipment. | Movement should look natural and unforced. Not an intense workout — this is about a woman who has her energy back and can exercise again without crashing afterward. |
| 4C | Woman walking outdoors — full body, confident stride, bright and alert | Same subject on a walking path, park, or sidewalk | Gimbal follow shot or locked tripod with subject walking toward camera | Full body or medium-wide, eye level | 10-15s | Natural light. Golden hour preferred for warm tones. | Comfortable casual clothing. | She walks toward the camera with a natural, easy stride. If the park or trail has greenery, frame it in the background — it reinforces the natural, health-forward aesthetic. |
| 4D | Woman at a desk or table — working, writing, or reading with focus and clarity | Same subject, indoor setting | Tripod or handheld | Medium shot, slightly above eye level | Hold for 10-15s | Natural window light or soft lamp light. | Casual professional clothing. Clean desk or table surface. A cup of tea visible if natural to the setting. | This shot represents the resolution of brain fog — one of the key Hashimoto's symptoms. She should look focused and alert, not strained. |

## Scene 5: Consultation B-Roll

**Setup:** Setup A or C from the Filming Guide — clinic consultation room

| Shot | Description | Subject | Camera | Angle / Framing | Duration | Lighting | Props / Wardrobe | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 5A | Dr. Vel in consultation with a patient — explaining something on an anatomical chart or diagram, gesturing and making eye contact | Dr. Vel and patient seated at consultation desk | Tripod, locked | Medium shot from the side, capturing both Dr. Vel and the patient in profile or three-quarter angle | Hold for 15-20s | LED panel from camera-left. Warm-white. | Dr. Vel in professional attire. Anatomical chart or thyroid diagram visible. Patient attentive. | This shot establishes Dr. Vel as a guide and educator. He is listening and explaining — not selling. Capture natural conversation. |
| 5B | Over-the-shoulder shot from behind the patient — showing Dr. Vel's face as he explains, with the patient's shoulder and back of head in the foreground | Same as 5A | Tripod or handheld | Over-the-shoulder, medium close-up of Dr. Vel | Hold for 15-20s | Same as 5A | Same as 5A | This gives the editor a complementary angle to cut between during the consultation sequence. |

## Notes for the Videographer

- This brief combines condition education (Dr. Vel teaching) with a composite patient narrative (lifestyle b-roll of a stand-in). There is no named patient testimonial on camera — the patient story is told through Dr. Vel's words, text overlays, and lifestyle footage.
- Film all clinic scenes (Scenes 1, 2, 3, 5) before moving to the lifestyle location (Scene 4) to avoid re-setting up at the clinic.
- Dr. Vel's educational segments (Scene 1) are the backbone of this video. Allow him to warm up with a practice run. Ask him to explain Hashimoto's as if talking to a patient sitting across from him — not as if delivering a presentation.
- Do not rush the TCM terminology explanations. The plain-language pairing is critical. If Dr. Vel says "spleen qi deficiency" without immediately explaining what it means in everyday terms, ask him to do the take again with the explanation built in.
- The lifestyle b-roll subject (Scene 4) does not need to be a real patient. A volunteer or model in her 30s-40s who can move naturally and comfortably on camera is sufficient. The face does not need to be shown prominently — much of this footage will be intercut under Dr. Vel's voiceover.
- Capture at least 3 takes of Shot 1E (the closing line). This is the most emotionally important moment and the line that will be used in promotional clips.
- The herbal medicine close-up (Shot 3E) should look like a clinical preparation, not an exotic arrangement. Keep it clean, orderly, and professional.
