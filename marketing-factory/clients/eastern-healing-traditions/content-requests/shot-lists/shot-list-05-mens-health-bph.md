## Scene 1: Lifestyle Portrait — Active, Confident Man

**Setup:** Outdoor natural light, handheld or tripod

| Shot | Description | Subject | Camera | Angle / Framing | Duration | Lighting | Props / Wardrobe | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1A | Man in his 50s-60s outdoors, active and confident. Standing with relaxed posture — hands in pockets, one hand on a fence rail, or holding a golf club / hiking pole. Looking at or slightly past the camera. Not smiling broadly — composed and self-assured. | Male patient volunteer, friend of Dr. Vel, or Dr. Vel himself (if appropriate for the ad) | Tripod or handheld in portrait mode | Three-quarter body (knees up) or waist up. Subject positioned slightly off-center with the natural environment filling the other side of the frame. | Capture 15-20 photos, varying posture and subtle expression changes | Natural light. Overcast or open shade preferred for even, flattering light. If shooting in direct sun, position the subject so the sun is behind them or to the side (not directly in their face). Golden hour (1-2 hours before sunset) is ideal. | Casual, put-together clothing: a quarter-zip pullover, flannel shirt, or polo. Earth tones — olive, charcoal, navy, khaki. No logos, no athletic wear, no suits. Clean, well-fitting. | The image should communicate "vitality" and "active life." NOT a generic fitness stock photo. NOT a man meditating on a rock. A real, relatable man who looks like he has things to do and places to be. The environment matters: a hiking trail, a workshop, a golf course, or a suburban backyard with a grill would all work. Avoid clinical settings — this ad runs on Facebook and should feel like a lifestyle post, not a medical ad. |
| 1B | Same subject, different angle — profile or three-quarter profile. Walking or in mid-activity. | Same as 1A | Handheld | Medium shot, slightly below eye level (empowering angle) | Capture 10-15 photos | Same natural light as 1A | Same as 1A | Motion adds energy. Have him walk toward the camera, pause, or gesture naturally. Candid-feeling shots work better than posed. Direct him to look at something specific off-camera (a distant point, the sky) for a natural gaze direction. |
| 1C | Same subject, tighter crop — shoulders up. Eye contact with camera. | Same as 1A | Tripod or handheld in portrait mode | Head and shoulders, centered or slightly off-center. Shallow depth of field. | Capture 10-12 photos | Same as above | Same as above | This tighter crop can work better with text overlays on the Facebook ad format (1200x628) where the face may be on one side and text on the other. |

## Scene 2: Clinical Detail (Optional — Can Reuse from Other Briefs)

If new photos are needed specifically for this brief:

| Shot | Description | Subject | Camera | Angle / Framing | Duration | Lighting | Props / Wardrobe | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2A | Dr. Vel's hands placing acupuncture needles on the lower abdomen area (the standard treatment region for BPH in TCM) | Dr. Vel's hands, male patient's lower abdomen | Tripod or steady handheld | Close-up from the side. Hands and treatment area visible, but framed modestly — no exposed underwear line or belt line. | Capture 8-10 photos | LED panel, warm-white. Same clinical setup as other treatment shots. | Dr. Vel in professional attire. Patient draped with a clean towel or sheet with only the treatment area visible. | This is a sensitive area. Frame conservatively. The shot should communicate "professional medical treatment" — nothing that could make the viewer uncomfortable. If this shot feels awkward to capture, skip it. The lifestyle photos (Scene 1) are sufficient for this brief. |
| 2B | Chinese herbal formulas — specifically the herbs commonly used for BPH / prostate support. Small display arrangement. | Herbal medicine | Tripod, 45-degree angle or flat-lay | Close-up of 3-4 herbal containers or loose herbs on a clean surface | Capture 6-8 photos | LED panel, even illumination | Clean surface, herbs neatly arranged. A small card or label identifying "prostate support formula" (optional). | This could serve as a secondary image for a carousel or blog post adaptation. Keep it clinical and professional. |

## Facebook Ad Image Specifications

| Element | Specification |
|---|---|
| Primary image | Photo 1A or 1C — the lifestyle portrait |
| Dimensions | 1200x628 (landscape, Facebook feed optimal) |
| Text overlay | A semi-transparent dark teal (#1a6b5a) bar across the bottom third or left third of the image. White headline text: "Getting up 3 times a night?" or "There's a reason your urologist didn't mention this option." Keep text minimal — Facebook deprioritizes image ads with heavy text. |
| CTA element | Gold (#c9a96e) accent line or small button-style element with "Learn More" |
| Branding | Eastern Healing Traditions logo or wordmark, small, bottom-right corner |

## Notes for the Photographer

- Subject selection is important for this brief. The ideal subject is a real man in his 50s-60s who looks healthy, active, and relatable. If Dr. Vel is in the right age range and comfortable being the subject, that can work — though using a different face adds variety to the content.
- If no suitable volunteer is available, consider asking a patient (with consent) or a friend. The authenticity of a real person far outperforms any stock image. The creative strategy explicitly prohibits stock photography.
- The outdoor setting should feel like somewhere this man would actually spend time. A golf course, a hiking trail near Grayslake, a home workshop, or a backyard deck are all good. A gym, a beach, or a yoga studio are not.
- Do NOT mention BPH, prostate, or the health condition during the photo session if the subject is not a real patient. The photos are lifestyle portraits that will be paired with text. The subject just needs to look confident and active.
- Deliver all photos at full resolution, unedited.
- This is a short shoot. It can be combined with another outdoor session (e.g., Patricia's lifestyle b-roll from Brief 01) if logistics allow.
