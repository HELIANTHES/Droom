## Brief 01: Surgery Cancellation Testimonial (Patricia J.)

### Facebook

**Ad Copy (Single Image / Video — Consideration)**

She was scheduled for shoulder surgery. She had lived with the pain for years. Physical therapy, medication, cortisone injections — nothing gave her lasting relief. Surgery felt like the only option left.

Then Patricia tried acupuncture.

Three sessions with Dr. Vel Natarajan at Eastern Healing Traditions. That is all it took. She canceled the surgery. Not because someone talked her out of it — because the pain was gone.

It did not stop there. Patricia also had sciatica so severe it limited how she walked, how she slept, how she lived. Five sessions of acupuncture — 95% pain relief.

Dr. Vel holds a DACM, the highest credential in Traditional Chinese Medicine. He does not guess. He evaluates, explains, and builds a treatment plan specific to your condition.

If surgery is on your calendar and nothing else has worked, a consultation costs nothing but a phone call.

## Brief 02: Condition Education — Fibromyalgia

### Facebook

**Ad Copy (Carousel — Awareness)**

Your fibromyalgia is not "all in your head." And it is not something you just have to live with.

Here is what most patients are not told: fibromyalgia is a condition of the nervous system. The pain is real. The fatigue is real. The cognitive fog is real. And conventional treatment — which typically stalls at symptom management with medications that carry their own side effects — is not your only option.

Traditional Chinese Medicine has been treating widespread pain and fatigue conditions for millennia. Modern research supports what practitioners have observed: acupuncture modulates the nervous system's pain signaling pathways, reducing the amplified pain response that defines fibromyalgia.

At Eastern Healing Traditions in Grayslake, Dr. Vel Natarajan (DACM) treats fibromyalgia with a comprehensive approach — acupuncture, Chinese herbal formulas tailored to your specific pattern, and Eastern nutrition protocols designed to reduce the inflammatory triggers that drive flare-ups.

This is not about replacing your rheumatologist. It is about filling the gap your current care cannot reach.

Swipe through the carousel to learn how TCM views and treats fibromyalgia differently.

Fibromyalgia. Widespread pain. Fatigue that sleep does not fix. Brain fog that makes you feel like a different person.

You have heard "your labs look normal." You have been told to manage it.

But here is what your doctor may not have explained: acupuncture modulates the nervous system's pain signaling pathways. Chinese herbal medicine addresses the root patterns — not just the symptoms. Eastern nutrition reduces the inflammatory triggers that keep the cycle going.

Dr. Vel Natarajan, DACM, treats fibromyalgia at Eastern Healing Traditions in Grayslake, IL. The approach is thorough, personalized, and designed to work alongside whatever care you are already receiving.

You deserve more than symptom management.

## Brief 03: First Appointment Walkthrough

### Facebook

**Ad Copy (Video — Consideration)**

Nervous about your first acupuncture appointment? You are not alone — and you do not have to be.

Here is exactly what happens when you visit Eastern Healing Traditions in Grayslake:

First, Dr. Vel sits down with you and listens. Not for five minutes — for as long as it takes to understand your full health picture. He checks your pulse and tongue (traditional diagnostic methods that reveal more than you might expect). Then he explains what he finds, in plain language, and outlines a treatment plan tailored to your specific condition.

The needles? Thinner than a strand of hair. Most patients feel nothing — or a mild sensation that fades in seconds. You rest for about 20 minutes. Most patients fall asleep.

That is it. No mystery. No pain. Just a calm, thorough, professional experience.

Dr. Vel Natarajan, DACM — the highest credential in Traditional Chinese Medicine.

## Brief 04: DACM Credential Authority

### Facebook

**Ad Copy (Carousel — Consideration)**

Would you see a dentist without a dental degree?

When choosing an acupuncturist, credentials matter — and most people do not realize that not all acupuncturists have the same level of training.

Here is the credential ladder:
- Certificate programs provide basic training.
- A Master's degree (MSOM) is the standard entry-level degree for licensed acupuncturists.
- The DACM — Doctor of Acupuncture and Chinese Medicine — is the highest degree in the field. It requires doctoral-level clinical training, advanced herbal pharmacology, biomedical integration, and research methodology.

Dr. Vel Natarajan holds a DACM. That means he does not just place needles — he evaluates, diagnoses patterns, prescribes herbal formulas, adjusts nutrition, and integrates 7 therapeutic modalities into a treatment plan built for your specific condition.

In Lake County, no other TCM practitioner holds this credential.

Your health deserves the highest standard of care.

## Brief 05: Men's Health — BPH and Prostate Health

### Facebook

**Ad Copy (Single Image — Awareness)**

Getting up 3 times a night? There is a reason your urologist did not mention this option.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) affects over half of men by age 60. The symptoms — frequent urination, weak flow, nighttime trips to the bathroom — are more than inconvenient. They affect your sleep, your energy, and your quality of life.

Most men are offered medication (with side effects) or told to wait until surgery becomes necessary. But acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine have been treating prostate and urinary conditions for centuries — and modern research supports their effectiveness.

At Eastern Healing Traditions in Grayslake, Dr. Vel Natarajan (DACM) creates individualized treatment plans using acupuncture, targeted herbal formulas, and Eastern nutrition protocols to address BPH symptoms at the root.

No pharmaceuticals. No surgery. Real results.

## Brief 06: Autoimmune — Hashimoto's Story

### Facebook

**Ad Copy (Video — Awareness/Consideration)**

Your thyroid levels are "normal." But you still feel exhausted. Your hair is thinning. You cannot lose the weight. The brain fog makes you feel like a different person. Your digestion has not been right in years.

You are not imagining it. And you are not "just stressed."

Hashimoto's thyroiditis is an autoimmune condition — your immune system is attacking your thyroid. Levothyroxine replaces the hormone your thyroid can no longer produce. But it does not stop the attack. It does not address the immune dysregulation, the inflammation, or the downstream effects on your digestion, energy, and emotional wellbeing.

That is the gap. And it is the gap that Traditional Chinese Medicine is designed to fill.

At Eastern Healing Traditions, Dr. Vel Natarajan (DACM) treats Hashimoto's patients with a comprehensive approach: acupuncture to regulate the immune and endocrine response, Chinese herbal formulas tailored to your individual pattern, and Eastern nutrition protocols to reduce the inflammatory triggers that keep the cycle going.

One patient — managing hormonal imbalance and digestive issues for years — reported both conditions resolved within 2 months of treatment.

The thyroid medication does its job. Our job is everything else.

"Hashimoto's is not a thyroid problem. It is an immune system problem."

That is how Dr. Vel Natarajan explains it — and it changes how you think about treatment.

Levothyroxine replaces the hormone. It does not stop your immune system from attacking your thyroid. It does not address the fatigue, the brain fog, the weight gain, the digestive issues that persist even when your labs say you are "fine."

TCM fills that gap. Acupuncture to calm the immune response. Herbal medicine to support the organs under strain. Nutrition to remove the inflammatory triggers.

One patient reported hormonal balance and digestive issues resolved in 2 months.

**Video Title:** How TCM Treats Hashimoto's Thyroiditis | What Your Medication Cannot Do

**Video Description:**
Your thyroid levels are "normal" — but you still feel exhausted, foggy, and nothing like yourself. If you have Hashimoto's thyroiditis, your medication is doing one important job: replacing the hormone your thyroid can no longer produce. But it is not stopping the immune attack. It is not addressing the fatigue, brain fog, weight gain, digestive issues, and hair loss that persist.

In this video, Dr. Vel Natarajan, DACM, explains the Hashimoto's gap — what medication manages, what it cannot, and how Traditional Chinese Medicine fills the difference.

Topics covered:
- Why Hashimoto's is an immune system problem, not just a thyroid problem
- The TCM perspective: spleen qi deficiency, kidney yang deficiency, liver qi stagnation (explained in plain language)
- Treatment approach: acupuncture, Chinese herbal medicine, Eastern nutrition
- Real patient outcomes: hormonal balance and digestive issues resolved in 2 months
